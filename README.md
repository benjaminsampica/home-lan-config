# üñ•Ô∏è LAN Gaming Setup ‚Äì Centralized Sync & Game Deployment

This repo contains a step-by-step guide and scripts to set up and manage LAN Windows 11 gaming PCs using a single ‚Äúmaster‚Äù server. With this system, you‚Äôll be able to:

- Deploy Windows 11 to all machines from one image
- Install or uninstall Steam games via a shared manifest
- Push those game changes out to all 8 clients in one click
- Host LAN game servers
- Keep everything in sync with a monthly update process

## üß± STEP 1 ‚Äì Prep the First Client PC

1. Install **Windows 11 Pro** on one of the LAN PCs.
2. Configure it fully:
   - Disable Cortana, News/Interests, etc.
   - Install all drivers and updates
   - Install Steam (but don‚Äôt log in)
   - Create folder: `C:\SteamGames`
   - Install any default tools (e.g., Chrome, MSI Afterburner)
3. Create a shared local admin account on the PC and prepare for imaging by running `master-client-machine-setup.ps1`.

## üì¶ STEP 2 ‚Äì Clone the Image to the Other PCs (Using Clonezilla)

**Recommended Tool: [Clonezilla Live](https://clonezilla.org/clonezilla-live.php)**

Clonezilla is a powerful, free, open-source disk imaging tool ideal for cloning identical Windows 11 PCs.

### üõ†Ô∏è On the Master PC

1. Download **Clonezilla Live ISO** and create a bootable USB using [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/).
2. Boot the master PC to Clonezilla via USB (tap `F12`, `DEL`, or your BIOS boot key).
3. Choose:
   ```
   device-image (to create an image)
   ```
4. Save the image to:
   - An external USB SSD/HDD, **or**
   - A network share (e.g., an SMB/NFS server on your LAN)
5. Reboot the computer to Windows for later steps.

---

### üíª On Each Client PC:

1. Plug in the **Clonezilla USB** and the **external image drive** (or connect to the image share).
2. Boot to Clonezilla.
3. Choose:
   ```
   device-image (to restore an image)
   ```
4. Select the stored image from the external drive or network location.
5. Write the image to the internal disk (Disk 0).
6. Once complete, remove USBs and reboot.
7. üåÄ Repeat for each of the 7 LAN clients.

On first boot, each PC will go through the Windows OOBE setup screen, and your preconfigured local admin (`LANAdmin`) will still be present.

## üåê STEP 3 ‚Äì Setup Shared Folder on Your Server

On your server (not a client machine).
1. Create a folder: `C:\SteamTools`
2. Inside it, place:
   - `games.json`
   - `sync_games.ps1`
3. Share this folder over the network:
   - Right-click > Properties > Sharing > Share > "Everyone" (read/write)
   - Example network path: `\\192.168.1.100\sync`

## üîÅ STEP 4 ‚Äì Configure Sync

1. Install [SteamCMD](https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/SteamCMD) on your server:
   - Extract to: `C:\SteamTools\SteamCMD`
2. Edit `games.jsonc` with the AppIDs to install or uninstall.
3. Run `sync_games.ps1` on the server to download and cache all game data into `C:\SteamGames`.

## üåê STEP 5 - LAN Cache Setup with lancache.net

To ensure games are only downloaded once and then served locally to all other PCs, this setup uses [lancache.net](https://lancache.net) on the server.

### üöÄ Why?

When any PC downloads a Steam game, the data is cached locally on the server. All future downloads or updates for that game are pulled at LAN speed from the cache instead of Steam‚Äôs servers.

### üß± Setup Overview

| Component          | Tool            | Host                  |
|-------------------|-----------------|-----------------------|
| Cache system       | `lancache.net`  | Your ‚Äúmaster‚Äù server  |
| DNS override       | Manual or DHCP  | Each LAN PC           |
| Cached games       | SSD/HDD         | Server local storage  |

### üß∞ Prerequisites

- [Docker Desktop](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop) installed on your server
- Static IP for the server (e.g., `192.168.1.100`)

### üì¶ Folder Structure

Create the following folder on your server:

```
C:\Lancache
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lancache-docker-compose.yml
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lancache
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lancache-dns
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ lancache-logs
```

### Run The Lancache Server

Run `lancache-setup.ps1`. This starts your local cache and DNS service.

### üñ•Ô∏è Configuring LAN PCs

On each LAN PC:
1. Go to Network Adapter settings > TCP/IPv4 > Properties
2. Set DNS to:

```
Preferred DNS: 192.168.1.100
Alternate DNS: 8.8.8.8
```

This ensures:
- If Lancache is up, downloads are cached
- If Lancache is down, the PC still connects to the internet normally

### ‚ö†Ô∏è If You Only Use the Cache DNS

If you set **only** `192.168.1.100` and the cache is offline, all internet access will break due to DNS failure. Always use a backup DNS (e.g., 8.8.8.8).

## üß® STEP 6 ‚Äì Push Sync to Clients

1. Download [PSExec](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/psexec) and extract to `C:\Tools\PsExec`.
2. Edit `push_sync.ps1`:
   - Update the PC names (e.g., `PC-01` to `PC-08`)
   - Replace `$adminUser` and `$adminPass` with the credentials you configured on the clients via `master-client-machine-setup.ps1`.
   - Confirm the share path is correct.
3. Run `push_sync.ps1` from your server to remotely sync all client machines using PsExec.

## üìÖ Updating The Clients Games Going Forward

When it‚Äôs time to sync:

1. Ensure every client PC is powered on, logged in, and connected to the network.
2. Update `games.jsonc` (add/remove games)
3. Run `sync_games.ps1` on the server to cache new data
4. Run `push_sync.ps1` on the server to push changes to all PCs
